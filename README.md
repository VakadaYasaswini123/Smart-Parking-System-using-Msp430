# Smart-Parking-System-using-Msp430
The rapid increase in vehicle population in recent years have given rise to a number of global problems such as air pollution, blockage of roads, waste of fuel and time. These issues exist due to the congestion caused by vehicles while finding the parking slot especially in metropolitan cities. Even today, many of the existing parking systems provide a passive information to the drivers regarding the availability of parking slots. Currently, the sensors deployed for detecting the vehicle presence in parking facilities are not reliable and are expensive. This project presents a comprehensive analysis on crucial aspects for designing a smart parking system such as sensor selection and optimal position for sensor deployment for accurate detection.
